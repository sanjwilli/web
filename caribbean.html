            <p>“The Caribbean today is characterized by grave intolerance and mistrust at all levels. Exploring our history, society and concepts of identity, give your informed perspective on this statement.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>From pre 1492 also known as pre-history until today the existence of people and their way of life in
      the Caribbean region is constantly being revised by historians. Arising from this today is the issue as
      to the existence of inter-relations between the Caribbean people? If so, how is it characterized? Is
      there trust and tolerance versus grave mistrust and intolerance? Research reveals that like the
      peoples of the pre- colonialization and colonialization eras, their existence was strongly driven by
      the need to survive and clinging to their own kind. Relatively today like the colonial period, the
      Caribbean society is driven by rules and morals; the latter which is unique to whichever country or
      people whilst the former is based on conformance to natural laws that was received from the
      English, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese Empires. Some countries within the region having gone
      through more than one colonization have developed a hybrid system. Essentially, this sums up the
      complexities of the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>The Caribbean is one of the most diverse regions, the “melting pot” a combination of varying
      cultures, people and experiences similarly mirroring definitions vantages. The most popular comes
      from geographers but more suitable is the historical definition.</p>

        <p>Now that we have defined the region in order to get a deeper understanding of the Caribbean society we question what is a society and more importantly how does it function? Sociologists have posited that a society is a group of people whose members interact, reside in a definable area, and share a culture. The revisionists share this view by further establishing that the civilization was existent in the Caribbean from primitive days outlining structured and identifiable subset cultures and functional societies so that culture encompassed groups sharing practices, values, beliefs, norms and artifacts. More specifically the sociologists painted societies based on varying views. The Functionalist view is that social institutions such as the family, school, religion, work and political are the drivers of a functional society. The Marxist perspective rests on the division of a people based on economic and social classes and coined the bourgeois concept. The Feminist views society as unequal based on the role of females vis-a-vis men in the functioning of society. The combination of these views show that there is an interrelationship amongst people particularly the Caribbean. This therefore requires trust and tolerance because of the diversity in language, locations, cultures and independent pursuits.</p>
        <div class="caribbean-sub-content">
          <h2>The Caribbean Identity – Trust and Tolerance, an historical perspective</h2>
          <p>In the Caribbean, the concepts of country, nation and State is the genesis of the need of belonging to
      a region. The difficulty is in defining a Caribbean identity as one unified people that share a common
      historical background and region. A part from the Caribbean people defining their identity based on
      a designated geographical area, do they truly share ascribed cultural identities. One postulates that
      each country has its own ethno cultural group’s differentiation. Thus, identity formation and its
      sustenance as time passes is relational and conflicting. People in general tend to cling to their own
      and this promotes the “we-they” concepts. Thus within each Caribbean State, there is an existence
      of subcultural conflicts in identity intensifying the oppositional oneness as a region. Research as

      shown that the Caribbean people are easy to identify with their own outside of the region than they
      would normally do in their homeland thus creating the fact of identity and double diasporic
      experience. In backtracking we note that the indigenous peoples habituated the Caribbean and
      formed communities largely driven by ethnic commonalities. Each had their own means of survival.
      The Neolithics were gatherers and producers whilst the Palaeolithics were nomads until they settled
      because their groups became too large. The latter survived from hunting and fishing. Soon the
      Saladoid peoples (Tainos and Kalinagos) emerged. The Tainos, a political and socially organized
      group spoke Arawakan and were mostly located in the Greater Antilles specializing in tools, axe and
      bladed and traded with other cultural groups. Conversely, the Kalinagos were more of expansionist
      and aggressively pursued this phase by moving up the Caribbean. Here we see an existence of
      different cultures, each having their own languages, way of life, practices, lifestyles and views.
      Today, we see remnants of these people and a continuum of varying cultures. The topical issue was
      there grave mistrust and intolerance in the Caribbean at that time. Historians never really painted
      this but is was thwarted by myths that fostered mistrust and intolerance and such a picture is what
      resonated in the combined efforts of the peoples to either welcome or fight against the Europeans
      arrival into the Caribbean in the early 15 th century. Trust existed merely in the reliance on closely
      networked communities where there were defined roles of members of families and chiefs.
      Bartering existed and soon trading was a sustainable means of gathering goods and services for
      which they never specialized in. One fact that eroded the trust and tolerance between the peoples
      was the influx of the European ethnocentric and androcentric views. Eurocentrism was merely
      treating the Caribbean indigenous peoples as inferior based on own culture and lifestyle comparison
      such lack of covering of the body was the dress code at the time versus fully clothed Europeans.
      Androcentrism was grounded on the males’ view of the females when they arrived as being sexual
      because they were not fully clothed resulting in sexual advances and violations of the women’s
      rights. The culture of the Indigenous Caribbean was slowly diluted with these views and new forced
      cultures emerged.</p>
