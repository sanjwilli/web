          <h2>Patriarchy Dying or Reviving ?</h2>
          <p>Gender relations and gender roles have been changing over the years, women will no longer accept the roles assigned to them in the home , school , church and society. Instead they are shattering the impervious boundaries and reaching to expand in different industries that were once male dominated.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>There has been a change in androcentrism and male dominance in society.</li>
            <li>Males  were expected to be  the head of society.</li>
            <li>Men were seen as the ones to be educated and receiving the better jobs while women were expected to be submissive and reserved.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="religion-sub-content">
          <h3>Religion Depicts women as subordinate and men as strong and  robust</h3>
          <p>The bible essentially presents women as a subset of men as it is inferred from the creation story in Genesis that God made women subordinate to men.The Quran also denotes that women should submit to their husbands. Now all that has changed women are forming their own meaning and idea of their roles and responsibilities in society. The  recently reported that the first black female bishop in England is a Jamaican born Rev Dr. Rose Josephine Hudson-Wilkin. The viewpoint that males should dominate the public space has changed. The skewed judgement  of the woman’s place in the church has been replaced with female pastors in the Caribbean,women are now liberated and this is evident not only in the new roles that they have taken on , but also in the way they dress and their interaction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="religion-sub-content">
          <h3>The Caregiver</h3>
          <p>Women are seeing to be a nurturer while men are seen as incapable of nurturing, the Caribbean has mistrust of child rearing by the father since mothers are seen as more emotional and able to relate and provide emotional support for the children. As a result there is mistrust with single fathers as we do not believe they are capable of raising children on their own.This is evident in our legal systems, mothers are more likely to receive guardianship/ custody than fathers, and also in schools, educators often request to have the mother visit the institution. Dominant socializing agent, tells a woman how she should dress and act, child rearing rules, be submissive to your husbands, women are allowed to be more vulnerable Hegemonic male, (men having power over women and other men because of , race , money , class ) now changes from just whites men to black men as well.</p>
          <p>(LGBT) can be referred under religion as well.</p>
          <p>Identity of  Caribbean has changed because of intolerance of the Eurocentric practices.

      I intolerance and mistrust in all aspects are deeply entwined in our history. My colleagues and I decided to embark on this journey to gain a higher sense of Caribbean identity ,understanding where we are from , having a different interpretation of why people do things the way they do , why society is the way they are.

      It is important to have a sense of history , without that knowledge we are not able to understand the way  society functions.</p>

          <h2>Intolerance in the Caribbean</h2>
          <p>The Caribbean may be defined as a geographic area consisting of the Archipelago that runs
      from the Yucatan Peninsula and Florida South East to Venezuela with the Greater Antilles
      (Cuba Hispaniola Puerto Rico and Jamaica) in the north and the Lesser Antilles. (Scott,C.M
      (2013) Caribbean .Inc Clark Nortrup (Ed.) Encyclopaedia of world trade : from ancient times
      to present. London,UK: Routledge.</p>
      <p>The word was coined from Europeans to mean Cannibalistic and militant but later came to
      be defined by the Caribbean people as region that shares socio- political, historical,
      economic and cultural space.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="religion-sub-content">
          <h3>Religious Intolerance In the Caribbean</h3>
          <p>The Caribbean people have experience a variety of religions from colonizers indoctrination
      and from their own origins. The Caribbean predominantly Christian, mainly Africans descent
      with hints of indigenous people whose ancestors were forced to practice Christianity by the
      Europeans. There is also a Significant Muslim and Hindu Population in countries such as
      Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Surinam. A few other secular religions such as
      Rastafarianism and Orisha are also practiced in the Caribbean.
      In some Caribbean countries religion play a huge role in the socio political decisions while in
      others (such as the major Christian societies) religion does not have such a significant
      impact.</p>
      <p>Religious pluralism has had a major impact on the way Caribbean people view and
      appreciate religion and the distinct practices.</p>
      <p>Since there is no law in the Caribbean preventing religious diversity (in fact the constitution
      protects it) people are free to express their beliefs. This might appear to be just for most
      persons but for some there is a level of scrutiny expressed,in regions where one religion is
      practiced that is not the prominent religion of that particular region. Eg. Persons of Islamic
      belief experience discrimination in schools, work and even in places of business. Even
      though the law provides the right to freedom of religion all religious practices are still not
      readily accepted in the Caribbean region.</p>
      <p>Eventhough religious intolerance has declined over the years there has been evidence of
      religious in toleration in the past in multiple cases.</p>
      <p>In December 2000 worshipers at the St.Lucia’s Minors Basilica of the Cathedral of the
      Immaculate Conception were set ablaze by two men resulting in death and injuries. The two
      men at trial expressed that they were sent by God (The Jamaica Observer, Sunday April
      26,2015 “Men who set worshiper on fire in St.Lucia sentenced to life in prison”)
      The New York Times also reported in July 1990 in an article entitled “ Trinidad Muslims
      Proclaim Revolt” a case where a musclim group in Trinidad attempted to overthrow the
      government.</p>
      <p>More recent intolerant religious behaviours exerted in the Caribbean also include
      discrimination of the Rastafarian religion in Jamaica</p>
        </div>
        <div class="religion-sub-content">
          <h3>Endogamous marriage</h3>
          <p>This sort of religious intolerance isn’t limited only to religion or restricted or restricted to
      st.lucia either as inter faith marriages are common in most countries and there is not many events in Caribbean history that provides proof of women being
      significant in religious practices.</p>
