          <h2>Social Caribbean</h2>
          <p>The Caribbean society is cemented on the pillars of the socialization process namely cultural, education, social strata, gender roles and sexual orientation.</p>
          <p>Culture is stratified within each state and amongst each nation. What is acceptable in the lower class may be frowned upon in the upper class and creates a dilemma when comparatives such as dancehall and carnival both exude similar traits but differing music genre. Ethnic centrism is more dominant now and may be seen as an intolerance and mistrust because people in one country are more likely to choose their own over another. But is this really mistrust and intolerance. Like the indigenous people, groups are more likely to remain akin to their culture. There is evidence of a coming together through Caribbean festivals, Carnivals and celebrations. People will travel across the region to participate in each festival season such Trinidad and Jamaica Carnival as well as Barbados Crop over. In the biography of Beryl McBurnie by Judy Raymond, there is evidence of high trust and tolerance as Miss McBurnie welcomed other Caribbean natives to Trinidad and Tobago and also travelled to other states such as Jamaica to promote Afro-centric music, dance, drama and cultural practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p> Today, we see Caribbean music calypso, soca, reggae and dancehall being listened to across the region. Even so, music collaborations between differing artistes also pushes the tolerance level higher such Shenseea and Nailah.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Language</h2>
          <p>Language is a critical marker of Caribbean identity. De Vos posits in relation to other parts of the world, “it is undoubtedly true that language constitutes the single most characteristic feature of separate ethnic identity.” Proper and formal usage of the official languages and dialects form the main construct of a people able to identify with their own.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>Caribbean people have shown respect for education institutions, scholars, published writers and lecturers from across the region. The University of the West Indies now ranking in the top 4% of universities in the world and 571 of approximately 3500. It started in 1948 in Mona, Jamaica, West Indies and later in St. Augustine, Trinidad 1961 and in 1963 Cave Hill Barbados. On May 27, 2019, the UWI’s 4 th landed Campus and 5 th Campus was established in Antigua and Barbuda. We see a heavy reliance on diverse Caribbean scholarly works and the movement of students to differing campuses to further their education. At this level trust and tolerance is evident but once students land in these countries that is where they will encounter mistrust and intolerance both received and sometimes given. The University forces students to adapt and forge mixed relations amongst people from different backgrounds, social strata and cultures. These mandates force persons to build trust and tolerance for example in this assignment with team members unknown to you because of a graded output requirement. Notable Professors have travelled the world and region imparting knowledge for the Arts the late Professor Rex Nettleford, the Social Sciences late Dr. Barry Chevannes, the Humanities Dr. Candia Hall-Mitchell, and Most Honourable PJ. Patterson.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Social</h2>
          <p>Classism, Racism, gender (male dominated), sexual orientation are amongst the leading tests of tolerance and trust. The lower class and upper class have exhibited grave mistrust from colonial days from the plantation society indoor and field slaves. Now, economic realms separates the “haves and have nots”. Racism and discrimination has always been existent under terms mentioned earlier as Eurocentrism and Androcentrism. Today, same exists but the Caribbean people are break glass walls and ceilings through educational advancement and wider opportunities more importantly a drive from the United Stations Sustainable Development goals. Gender empowerment has seen women moving from their traditional roles for child bearing and family preparation to holders’ of high positions in companies and parliaments. Some have even headed States in the Caribbean. The margin of Patriarchal society is fastly diminishing and tolerance levels are increasing as women rise up the corporate ladder. Relationships amongst partners is also evidence of grave mistrust and intolerance based on stereotypes and historical behaviours between men and women. Men are purported to be cheaters but in recent studies in Jamaica 2019 revealed that 1 out of every 3 children are not biologically related to their fathers. So this breeds grave mistrust in relationships and others looking on. Sexual Orientation is a big public outcry and any relationship other than heterosexual is outlawed in some countries and morally unacceptable despite the Constitutional Rights to freedom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Health</h2>
          <p>The Jamaica Moves health campaign to reduce non-communicable diseases has forged great trust and tolerance as there is now the Caribbean Moves and countries such as Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda and Trinidad and Tobago logging on to reduce these health issues affecting the Caribbean population.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Religion</h2>
          <p>People will naturally affiliate with a church, denomination of form of religion based on upbringing. So one can leave Jamaica and willingly attend a Seventh Day Adventist Church when visiting Grenada because of the uniformed known principles. Some religious practices are still outlawed in the Caribbean for which grave mistrust and intolerance is evidenced. These are voodoo practiced in Haiti banned by the Obeah Act and arranged child marriages in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal through enacted legislation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Sport</h2>
          <p>As a people, the Caribbean is unified when we have an integrated team representing in World Cup or in the International Arena. But great mistrust happens when each nation competes individually as is with any people. Good sportsmanship and tolerance is evident in the mixed team’s formation of the West Indies Cricket team managed by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). Despite the varying governance strife over the years, the WICB has managed to continue the earliest forge of trust in the Caribbean through entrusting each player from a Caribbean state to perform a role for which the team is highly dependent. We the Caribbean people follow them in the World Cup and 20/ 20 seasons often times selecting favourites who are often not from our own country namely Brian Lara.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <h2>Natural Disaster</h2>
          <p>The deepest level of trust and tolerance happens in the Caribbean when there is a natural disaster. The region lies within the tropics and is not isolated from hurricanes, earthquakes and pandemics. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) headquartered in Barbados was established in 1991 and is headed by Jamaican Mr. Ronald Jackson. The Agency with the responsibility to coordinate emergency response and relief for participating states has helped in recent times Bahamas after the passing of Hurricane Dorian in September 2019 and also Dominica and other islands during late 2016-17. To date 18 countries are members. Caribbean people pull together in times of adversity.</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>
          <h4>In summary as quoted by Ralph Premdas</h4>
          <p>“This identity exists everywhere in the hearts of individuals in the divided diaspora and nowhere in reality. It is invoked and used to justify rival claims and to stake out new territory for exploitation, but is diluted and compromised by the claims of new identities emanating from their new home environment in the industrial countries. It is in this respect a divided if not schizophrenic identity, dwelling in several locations simultaneously. In a global perspective of mass migration, it is not an unusual identity. It is a quest for community in a fragmented and fractured world in which the Caribbean is a mirror.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div class="social-sub-content">
          <p>The Caribbean identity should be characterized as a mixed trust and tolerant group of people that are forging relations across borders and slowly removing major barriers that inhibit social cohesion. It should be noted that naturally people will put up a defence to foreign cultures and practices until it becomes a norm.</p>
